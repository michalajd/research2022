UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB18 and RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB18 and RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 384 of such cell types but only 270 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 192 of such cell types but only 135 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#3 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB36E1 over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB36E1 cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 192 of such cell types but only 135 compatible sites are available in the target device.

Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
